00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] When you're working on a React project

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.000
it's a good idea to have some sort

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.006
of place to write your code.

4
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:06.009
One of the tools we can use

5
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.005
to write code is Visual Studio Code,

6
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.005
so, this is totally free.

7
00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:14.000
If you don't have this installed already

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
it's one I would recommend,

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.005
you can always download it from the website,

10
00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:21.009
if you're using a PC it will prompt you

11
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.006
to download it for a PC.

12
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:25.009
If you're using a Mac, you can download it here.

13
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.000
So, we're going to go through the steps of installing VS Code,

14
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.004
it'll download this to a zip folder.

15
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:35.002
Nice, so once that's downloaded

16
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:38.001
we can click on it to expand the zip,

17
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:42.001
then we're going to see this here in our downloads folder

18
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.006
and we can go ahead and open it up.

19
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:45.006
Once you open this,

20
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.007
you're going to be able to open up your exercise files here,

21
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:50.004
so again, you have access

22
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:53.001
to the exercise files from this class.

23
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:56.002
One of the easiest ways of getting started I feel like,

24
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:59.007
is to drag your exercise files folder

25
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:02.003
over the Visual Studio Code editor

26
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:04.000
and then you're going to have access

27
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.005
to all of them here, which is pretty cool.

28
00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:08.006
Another thing to do once you install VS Code

29
00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:11.001
for the first time is to go up here

30
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:15.001
to the code menu, check preferences,

31
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.000
and one of the things that people always ask me

32
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.009
about my code editor

33
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.002
is it's the most important thing, right?

34
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:25.009
What does your, what color theme are you using?

35
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.001
So, you can find different color themes

36
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:31.006
if you go to preferences and then you select color theme,

37
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:35.003
here you see a whole list of them that you can choose from,

38
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:39.002
so whatever feels right to you, you can pick.

39
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:43.001
The one I'll be using for this class is called Night Owl

40
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:46.001
and if you don't already have Night Owl installed

41
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:51.001
you can go to preferences, you can go then to extensions

42
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:55.005
and then you can search for Night Owl in your extensions,

43
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:57.002
and then you can click install.

44
00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:59.009
Obviously, if you prefer to use a different theme

45
00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.002
or a different code editor entirely,

46
00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:05.006
that's totally great and I encourage you to do so.

47
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:08.007
Another thing I want to point out is if you go

48
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:15.001
to your browser and you type react.new into that new tab

49
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.003
react.new will give you a CodeSandbox

50
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:18.001
that you can work with.

51
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:19.006
So, think of CodeSandbox

52
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:22.003
as being like VS Code in the browser,

53
00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:25.006
you can use it for free, develop your own apps,

54
00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.008
notice that you need to sign in.

55
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:30.003
So, you would sign in either with your GitHub account

56
00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:32.004
or with your Google account, but once you do that

57
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:33.006
you're going to have everything

58
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:35.006
you need to get started on a project.

59
00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:38.002
So, don't feel like you have to run

60
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:40.001
anything locally using VS Code,

61
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:43.003
you can always go to react.new in the browser,

62
00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:46.003
fire up a CodeSandbox and get started that way.

63
00:02:46.003 --> 00:02:48.009
And then there are other tools for this type of thing, too.

64
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.006
If you want to check out CodePen,

65
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:52.005
this is a really nice one as well.

66
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:55.001
CodePen allows you to build, test,

67
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:58.003
and discover front end code as their tagline suggests.

68
00:02:58.003 --> 00:02:59.007
There's also an app called Glitch

69
00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:01.000
which I would recommend too.

70
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.005
So, lots of different ways to get started,

71
00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:05.008
but the important part is that we have some sort

72
00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:09.001
of location where we can write this front end code.
